# Open Sunday

## What?

A tool that allows you to search for businesses that are open on a Sunday, in a given area.

## Why?

We struggled to find a barbershop that was open on a Sunday and thus, the idea was born!

## How?

Using the Google Maps & Places APIs mixed with a teaspoon of React & TypeScript 👌

## Setup & Installation

- npm i
- npm run dev
- opens on localhost:8080

## Still to do (in no particular order)

- Add validation on postcode fields / feed postcode error back to user
- Add credit link to my own website (shameless plug)
- Add new place types and lookups to match
- Add a nicer loading screen to replace the spinner
- Phase out remaining instances of "any"
